 * Scala Subway Switcheroo
 * All aboard the Scala express! ðŸš‚ Your mission, 
 * should you choose to accept it, is to modify the starter 
 * code to print out the last car of the subway train 
 * instead of the first one. Remember how arrays work 
 * in Scala, and tap into that knowledge here. 
 * One tiny rule: no hardcoding the index! Ready? 
 * Let's get those wheels rolling and go coding!
