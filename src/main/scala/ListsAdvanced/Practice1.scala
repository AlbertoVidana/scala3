 * Appending a Task to the To-Do List in Scala

 * Imagine you have a to-do list for the day. 
 * You've already written down some tasks, and you 
 * want to include another vital task: "Take a walk." 
 * The given code manages this list and shows how to 
 * append a new task. Letâ€™s run the code to see 
 * the to-do list after adding the new task.
