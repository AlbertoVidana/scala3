    (-_-) BAD ANSWER
    Good try, but there are a couple of things to adjust:

    The board should be 2x2, not 3x3.
    You need to print the content of a specific cell, not all rows.

    Would you like some help with these adjustments? ðŸ¤”

  // TODO: Access and print the content of a cell on the game board
  println(s"Row 1: ${ticTacToe(0)(0)}")
