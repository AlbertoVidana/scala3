/**
  * Welcome to the Scala Pancake Cooking Task! üçΩÔ∏è In this task, you'll create a simple and fun function in Scala called cookPancake.

Your function will accept three parameters:

    The amount of flour in grams
    The number of eggs
    The amount of milk in milliliters

Once you have your function defined, you'll call it to simulate preparing a pancake with the specified amounts of ingredients.

Expected message: "Cooking pancake with X grams of flour, Y eggs, and Z ml of milk."

Ready? Let's get cooking!
